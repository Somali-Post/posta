          After a 34-year hiatus, the Somali Postal Service is back, reconnecting our nation with the world. Our mission is to rebuild and modernize Somalia’s postal infrastructure, providing reliable, secure, and efficient services that foster communication, commerce, and national pride. We are more than just a mail service; we are a symbol of Somalia&rsquo;s resilience and a bridge to its future.
